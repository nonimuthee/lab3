             <p>Sloths are tree-dwelling mammals known for their slow movements, which help them conserve energy and avoid predators. There are six species of sloths divided into two families:
                 
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Two-Toed Sloths (Choloepus):</strong> Larger and more active at night.</li>
                <li><strong>Three-Toed Sloths (Bradypus):</strong> Smaller, diurnal, and equipped with a permanent "smile" due to their facial structure.</li>
                </ul>
             
             <h2> Unique Adaptations:</h2>             
             
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Slow Metabolism: :</strong> Larger and more active at night.</li>
                <li><strong>Three-Toed Sloths (Bradypus):</strong> Smaller, diurnal, and equipped with a permanent "smile" due to their facial structure.</li>
